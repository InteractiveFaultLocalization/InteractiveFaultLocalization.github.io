content="CharmFL is a fault localization tool for Python, which can be integrated into the PyCharm IDE. After running the Python unit tests in your project, it constructs a spectrum and the suspiciousness scores for each program element. It also provides context for localizing faults. You can see different visualizations of your code and program spectra." %}

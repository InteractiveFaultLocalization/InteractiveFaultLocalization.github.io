## Introduction

{% include right-img.html img="/mascot/alg_ranks_v2.png" img-width="33%"
content="We are presenting iFL for Eclipse, an Eclipse plug-in supporting iFL for Java projects developed in this environment. It supports the popular Eclipse IDE, so it is part of the well-known workspace of developers. The plug-in reads the tree of project elements (classes and functions) and lists them in a table showing detailed information about those elements. This information includes, among others, the suspiciousness scores calculated using a traditional SBFL formula, which ranks code components (e.g., methods) according to their probability of having faults. For example, Tarantula is one of these algorithms. This table also enables direct navigation toward the project tree and the contained source code elements." %}

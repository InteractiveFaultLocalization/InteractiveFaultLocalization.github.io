## Raw Data from the Think Aloud Protocols in 2021

In 2021, we conducted an experiment with 6 developer using the [Think Aloud Protocol](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1980-24435-001). The collected raw data are available under the following sections. For more details check our publications.

### Transcription of the Videos

We obtained video material of total length of 33 hours and 57 minutes.
Each video frame was composed of two parts: the participants screen area and video footage.
We created a transcription of each recorded video in form of subtitles (SRT format) with additional information about gestures and other activities of the participants such as relevant changes of facial expression, gesticulation, and other environment factors (this is similar to subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for movies).
After this step, all the videos could be edited to remove identifying information, that is video and voice of the participant, and leave only the screen capture part with the transcript.

You could download the transcripts [here](TBA).
